After running the PCM, an output file called diagfi.nc will be created containing your results. 

Use these files to read the diagfi.nc file and to create figures using the GrADS visualization software.

`0ani.gs` can be used to creates a single image.

`animate.gs` creates a series of images that can then be compiled to create an animation. To create an animation from ouputted images, use a 3rd party site, such as https://imgflip.com/gif-maker or https://ezgif.com/maker

`surface.ctl` and `surface.dat` contain surface data of Mars.
