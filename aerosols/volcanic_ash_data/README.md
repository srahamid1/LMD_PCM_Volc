This directory contains IR and visible volcanic ash data from various volcanoes. Files contain wavenumber, n, and k data. Wavenumber needs to be converted to wavelegnth for use with Mie code. See spreadsheet titled "Radiatively Active Ash" for conversions to wavelength as well as extra plots to visualize IR and visible data. See also input file examples (files that begin with "optind") for examples on how to format text file to be used by Mie code. 

All volcanic ash data was downloaded from the Aerosol Refractive Index Archive https://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/ARIA/data
