Using the modified LMD PCM I simulated the eruption of water from the Athabasca Valles flood lava eruption. See my publication for more information on this project (Currently in prep, I will update once it's officially published).

I created a zip file that contains all input and output files used in this study for you to view and replicate the results. Download the zip file here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/we533djh4qh0j70y0xc0j/athabasca-eruption.zip?rlkey=kz7pjqk9alata5hipgqkjunp9&st=ab9gflu6&dl=0
