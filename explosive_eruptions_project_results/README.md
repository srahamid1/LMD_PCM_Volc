I simulated explosive eruptions of water and sulfur from Apollinaris Mons and Syrtis Major using a modified version of the LMD PCM. See my publication for more information on this project (Currently in prep, I will update once it's officially published).

I created a zip file that contains input and output files used in this study for you to view and replicate the results. 
The various diagif.nc output files generated after a model run, which contain instantaneous values of the main model variables (atmospheric temperature, winds, volcanic water, sulfur, etc.), is not included in the zip file because they are far too large (6â€“100 GB). With the version of the model I provide and the input files, you should be able to replicate my results. If you would like my diagfi.nc files to compare your results to or to simply just view mine, please reach out to me and I can send it to you.
