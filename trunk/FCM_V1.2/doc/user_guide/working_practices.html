  <h1>Code Management Working Practices</h1>

  <p>The previous chapter described how to use the various parts of the FCM
  code management system. They also described aspects of working practises
  which are enforced by the system. This section discusses other recommended
  working practises.  They are optional in the sense that you don't have to
  follow them to use FCM.  It is a matter for individual projects to decide
  which working practises to adopt (although we expect most projects/systems
  at the Met Office to adopt similar practises).</p>

  <h2><a name="changes">Making Changes</a></h2>

  <p>This sub-section gives an overview of the recommended approach for
  preparing changes. Particular topics are discussed in more detail
  in later sub-sections where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The recommended process for making a change is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Before work starts on any coding you should make sure that
	there is a Trac ticket open which explains the purpose of the change.
	<ul>
	  <li>Make sure that you set the ticket milestone to indicate
	      which release of the system you are aiming to include
	      your change in.
	  <li>Accept the ticket to indicate that you are working on the change.
	  <li>For further advice on using tickets see
	      <a href="#tickets">Trac Tickets</a> later in this section.
	</ul>
    <li>Create a branch
	<ul>
	  <li>For very simple changes you may be happy to prepare your changes
	      directly on the trunk. For further details see
	      <a href="#branching_when">When to Branch</a> later in this section.
	  <li>Create your branch either from the latest version or from a stable
	      release (see <a href="#branching_where">Where to Branch From</a>
	      later in this section).
	</ul>
    <li>Prepare your code changes on the branch
	<ul>
	  <li>Commit interim versions to your branch on a regular basis as you
	      develop your change. This makes it much easier to keep track of
	      what you're changing and to revert changes if necessary.
	  <li>You may wish to merge in changes from the trunk. For further details see
	      <a href="#branching_update">Merging From the Trunk</a> later in this section.
	      <ul>
		<li>Make sure that you always commit any local changes to your branch
		    before doing a merge. Otherwise it becomes impossible to distinguish
		    your changes from those you have merged in. It is also impossible to
		    revert the merge without losing your local changes.
		<li>Likewise, always commit the merge to your branch (after resolving any
		    conflicts) before making any further changes.
	      </ul>
	  <li>Don't include unrelated changes. If you want to make some changes which
	      aren't really associated with your other changes then use a separate ticket and
	      branch for these changes.
	</ul>
    <li>Once your changes are ready for review, update the Trac ticket to record
	which version of the branch is to be reviewed and assign the ticket to your reviewer.
    <li>If the reviewer is happy with the change then he/she should update the ticket
	to record that the change is approved and assign the ticket back to you.
	<ul>
	  <li>The reviewer can use the command
	      <tt>fcm&nbsp;diff&nbsp;--branch &lt;branch_name&gt;</tt> to examine all of the
	      changes on the branch.
	  <li>If changes are necessary then these should be prepared and then the
	      ticket updated to refer to the new version under review.
	</ul>
    <li>Once the change is approved it can be merged back to the trunk
	<ul>
	  <li>If you have been merging the latest changes from the trunk onto your
	      branch then the merge should be automatic. If not you may have
	      conflicts to resolve.
	  <li>Make sure that each merge is a separate commit to the trunk.
	      i.e. Don't combine changes from several branches in one commit.
	      This makes it easier to reverse changes if necessary. It also
	      makes the changeset easier to understand.
	  <li>Make sure that you use a good log message to describe your change.
	      For further details see <a href="#messages">Commit Log Messages</a>
	      later in this section.	      
	  <li>Once the changes are commited, update the ticket to refer to the
	      changeset. Then the ticket can be closed.
	</ul>
    <li>Once you are finished with the branch it should be deleted.
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="wc">Working Copies</a></h2>

  Some points to consider regarding working copies:

  <ol>
    <li>In general we recommend that you keep your working copies in your home directory.
	This ensures that any local changes which you accidently delete can be recovered
	via the snapshot facility (on Met Office Exeter and Reading based systems).
    <li>If the size of your project is small then you will probably find it easiest to
	work with a complete copy of the project (either the trunk or your branch).
	This means that you always have immediate access to all the files and that you
	are always able to perform merges using your normal working copy.
    <li>If you have a large project then you may prefer to work on a sub-tree of your
	project.
	<ul>
	  <li><em>Pros:</em>
	      <ul>
		<li>Subversion operations on your working copy are faster.
		<li>Your working copies use up less disk space. Remember that
		    you may be working on several changes at once on separate branches
		    so you may wish to have several working copies.
	      </ul>
	  <li><em>Cons:</em>
	      <ul>
		<li>You cannot always perform merge operations in sub-trees (if
		    the changes which need to be merged include files outside of
		    your sub-tree). To handle this we suggest that if you need to
		    perform a merge using a complete copy of your project you
		    check it out in your $LOCALDATA area (local disk space which
		    is not backed up) to be used purely for doing the merge.
		<li>You may find that your change involves more files than you originally
		    thought and that some of the files to be changed lie outside of your
		    working copy. You then have to make sure that you have committed any
		    changes before checking out a larger working copy.
	      </ul>
	</ul>

  </ol>
  
  <h2><a name="branching">Branching &amp; Merging</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="branching_when">When to Branch</a></h3>

  <p>If you are making a reasonably large change which will take more than a
  hour or two to prepare then there are clear advantages to doing this work on a
  branch.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can commit intermediate versions to the branch.</li>

    <li>If you need to merge in changes from the trunk then you have a record
    of your files prior to the merge.</li>

    <li>The version of the code which gets reviewed is recorded. If subsequent
    changes are required then only those changes will need reviewing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, if you are only making a small change (maybe only one line)
  should you create a branch for this? There are two possible approaches:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The <em>Always Branch</em> system

      <ul>
        <li>ALL coding changes are prepared on branches.</li>

        <li><em>Pros:</em> Same process is followed in all cases.</li>

        <li><em>Cons:</em> The extra work required to create the branch and
        merge it back to the trunk may seem unnecessary for a very small
        change.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The <em>Branch When Needed</em> system

      <ul>
        <li>Small changes can be committed directly to the trunk (after testing
        and code review).</li>

        <li><em>Pros:</em> Avoids the overhead of using branches.</li>

        <li><em>Cons:</em> Danger of underestimating the size of a change. What
        you thought was a small change may turn out to be larger than you
        thought (although you can always move it onto a branch if this
        happens).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is a matter for project policy although, in general, we would
  recommend the <em>Branch When Needed</em> approach.</p>

  <h3><a name="branching_where">Where to Branch From</a></h3>

  <p>When you create a new branch you have two choices for which revision to
  create the branch from:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The latest version of the trunk.

      <ul>
        <li>This is the preferred choice where possible. It minimised the
        chances of conflicts when you need to incorporate your changes back
        onto the trunk.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>An older version of the trunk. There are a number of reasons why you
    may need to do this. For example:

      <ul>
        <li>You are using a stable version to act as your "control" data.</li>

        <li>You need to know that your baseline is well tested (e.g. scientific
        changes).</li>

        <li>Your change may need to be merged with other changes relative to a
        stable version for testing purposes or for use in a package (see
        <a href="#packages">Creating Packages</a> later in this section).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="branching_update">Merging From the Trunk</a></h3>

  <p>Once you've created your branch you need to decide whether you now work in
  isolation or whether you periodically merge in the latest changes from the
  trunk.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Regularly merging from the trunk minimises the work involved when you
    are ready to merge back to the trunk. You deal with any merge issues as you
    go along rather than all at the end (by which time your branch and the
    trunk could have diverged significantly).</li>

    <li>One downside of merging from the trunk is that the baseline for your
    changes is a moving target. This may not be what you want if you have some
    "control" results that you have generated.</li>

    <li>Another downside of merging from the trunk is that it may introduce
    bugs. Although any code on the trunk should have been tested and reviewed
    it is unlikely to be as well tested as code from a stable release.</li>

    <li>Unless you originally created your branch from the latest version of
    the trunk it is unlikely that you are going to want to merge in changes
    from the trunk. The exception to this is once your change is complete when
    it may make sense to merge all the changes on the trunk into your branch as
    a final step. This is discussed in
    <a href="#branching_commit">Merging Back to the Trunk</a> below.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, there are basically three methods of working:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Branch from a stable version and prepare all your changes in isolation.

      <ul>
        <li>Necessary if you need to make your change relative to a well tested
        release.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Branch from the latest code but then prepare all your changes in
    isolation.

      <ul>
        <li>Necessary if you need a stable baseline for your "control"
        data.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Branch from the latest code and then update your branch from the trunk
    on a regular basis.

      <ul>
        <li>This is considered "best practise" for parallel working and should
        be used where possible.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="branching_commit">Merging Back to the Trunk</a></h3>

  <p>Before merging your change back to the trunk you will need to test your
  change and get it reviewed. There are two options for what code to test and
  review:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Test and review your changes in isolation. Then merge to the trunk and
    deal with any conflicts at this stage. This may be the best method if:

      <ul>
        <li>Your changes have already been tested against a stable baseline and
        re-testing after merging would be impracticable.</li>

        <li>Your branch needs to be available for others to merge in its
        changes in isolation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Merge in the latest code from the trunk before your final test and
    review. This has the advantage that you are testing and reviewing the
    actual code which will be committed to the trunk. However, it is possible
    that other changes could get committed to the trunk whilst you are
    completing your testing and review. There are several ways of dealing with
    this:

      <ul>
        <li>Use locking to prevent it happening. The danger with this is that
        you may prevent others from being able to get their change tested and
        reviewed, hence inhibiting parallel devlopment.</li>

        <li>Insist that the change is re-tested and reviewed. The problem with
        this is that there is no guarantee that the same thing won't happen
        again.</li>

        <li>Merge in the new changes but don't insist on further testing or
        review.

          <ul>
            <li>In most cases any changes won't clash so there is little to
            worry about.</li>

            <li>Where there are clashes then, in most cases, they will be
            trivial with little danger of any side-effects.</li>

            <li>Where the clashes are significant then, in most cases, this
            will be very obvious whilst you are resolving the conflicts. In
            this case you should repeat the testing and get the updates
            reviewed.</li>
          </ul>This is the recommended approach since it doesn't inhibit
          parallel development and yet the chances of a bad change being
          committed to the trunk are still very small.
        </li>
      </ul>

      You should also consider what can be done to minimise the time taken
      for testing and review.
      <ul>
	<li>Try to keep your changes small by breaking them down where possible.
	    Smaller changes are easier and quicker to review. This also
	    helps to minimise merge problems by getting changes back onto the
	    trunk earlier.
	<li>Automate your testing as far as possible to speed up the process.
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Most projects will require the developer who prepared the change to merge
  it back to the trunk once it is complete. However, larger projects may wish
  to consider restricting this to a number of experienced / trusted
  developers.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This makes it easier to control and prioritise the merges.</li>

    <li>It applies an extra level of quality control.</li>

    <li>It minimises the risk of mistakes being merged back on to the trunk by
    less experienced developers</li>

    <li>Scientific developers can concentrate on the scientific work.</li>

    <li>One issue is that the person doing the merge to the trunk may need help
    from the original developer to prepare a suitable log message.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="branching_delete">When to Delete Branches</a></h3>

  <p>Once you are finished with your branch it is best to delete it to avoid
  cluttering up the directory tree (remember that the branch and all its
  history will still be available). There are two obvious approaches to
  deleting branches.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Delete the branch as soon as it has been merged back to the trunk
    (prior to closing any associated Trac ticket).

      <ul>
        <li>This is the tidiest approach which minimises the chances of old
        branches being left around.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Delete the branch once a stable version of the system has been released
    which incorporates your change.

      <ul>
        <li>If a bug is found in your change during integration testing then
        you can prepare the fix on the original branch (without having to do
        any additional work to restore the branch).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="binary">Working with Binary Files</a></h2>

  <p>The <tt>fcm conflicts</tt> command and <tt>xxdiff</tt> can only help you
  resolve conflicts in text files. If you have binary files in your repository
  you need to consider whether conflicts in these files would cause a problem.</p>

  <h3><a name="binary_conflicts">Resolving Conflicts in Binary Files</a></h3>

  <p>Conflicts in some types of binary files can be resolved manually. When you
  are satisfied that the conflicts are resolved, issue the <tt>fcm resolved</tt>
  command on the file to remove the conflict status. (You will be prevented from
  committing if you have a conflicting file in your working copy.)</p>

  <p>If you have a conflicting MS Office 2003 document, you may be able to take
  advantage of the "Compare and Merge Documents" facility under the "Tools" menu
  in a MS Office application. Consider a working copy, which you have just
  updated from revision 100 to revision 101, and someone else has committed some
  changes to a file <tt>doument.doc</tt> you are editing, you will get:</p>

  <table class="pad" summary="Conflicts in a binary file" border="1"
  width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Conflicts in a binary file</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm conflicts
Conflicts in file: document.doc
document.doc: ignoring binary file, please resolve conflicts manually.
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm status
=&gt; svn st
?      document.doc.r100
?      document.doc.r101
C      document.doc
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Open <tt>document.doc.r101</tt> with MS Word. In <em>Tools &gt; Compare
  and Merge Documents...</em>, open <tt>document.doc</tt>. You will be in Track
  Changes mode automatically. Go through the document to accept, reject or merge
  any changes. Save the document and exit MS Word when you are ready. Finally,
  issue the <tt>fcm resolved</tt> command to remove the conflict status:</p>

  <table class="pad" summary="Resolved conflicts in a binary file" border="1"
  width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Resolved conflicts in a binary file</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm resolved document.doc
=&gt; svn resolved document.doc
Resolved conflicted state of 'document.doc'
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm status
=&gt; svn st
M      document.doc
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Another type of conflict that you may be able to resolve manually is where
  the binary file is generated from another file which can be merged. For
  instance, some people who use LaTeX also store a PDF version of the document in
  the repository. In such cases it is easy to resolve the conflict by
  re-generating the PDF file from the merged LaTeX file and then issuing the
  <tt>fcm resolved</tt> command to remove the conflict status. Note that, in this
  particular case, a better approach might be to automate the generation of the
  PDF file outside of the repository.</p>

  <h3><a name="binary_locking">Using Locking</a></h3>

  <p>For files with binary formats, such as artwork or sound, it is often
  impossible to merge conflicting changes. In these situations, it is necessary
  for users to take strict turns when changing the file in order to prevent time
  wasted on changes that are ultimately discarded.</p>

  <p>Subversion supports <em>locking</em> to allow you to prevent other users
  from modifying a file while you are preparing changes. For details please refer
  to the chapter
  <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.advanced.locking.html">
  Locking</a> from the Subversion book. Note that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>FCM does not add any functionality to the locking commands provided by
    Subversion.</li>

    <li>If you need to lock a file you must do this in a working copy of the
    trunk. There is nothing to stop you preparing the changes in a branch (maybe
    you want to prepare the change in combination with a number of other changes
    which do not require locking). However, you must always remember to lock the
    file in the trunk first to prevent other users from preparing changes to the
    file in parallel.</li> 

    <li>Locking isn't the only way of preventing conflicts with binary files. If
    you only have a small project team and a small number of binary files you may
    find it easier to use other methods of communication such as emails or
    just talking to each other. Alternatively, you may have a working practise
    that particular files are only modified by particular users.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a name="messages">Commit Log Messages</a></h2>

  <p>Certain guidelines should be adhered to when writing log messages for code
  changes when committing to the trunk:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Try to start off the log message with one line indicating the general
    nature of the change. This helps developers to tell whether a change is
    important to them when viewing the Trac timeline view.</li>

    <li>If you want to use bullets in your message then make them compatible
    with <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting">Wiki
    Formatting</a>. For example:

      <table class="pad" summary="Example bullets using wiki formatting"
      border="1" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
No bullet
 * First level bullet (single space at beginning)
   * Second level bullet (three spaces at beginning)
 1. Numbered item instead of a bullet
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>This will ensure that the log message is displayed with proper
      bullets in the Trac changeset view. You can also include other types of
      wiki formatting but please be aware that the message still needs to be
      readable when simply viewed as text (e.g. via <tt>fcm&nbsp;log</tt>).
    </li>

    <li>If your changes close a Trac ticket, make sure that your log message
    refers to this using <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracLinks">Trac
    Links</a>, e.g. <tt>Closes issue #26.</tt></li>

    <li>Don't leave blank lines at the end of your log message since they get
    included in the message and, therefore, get included in the ouptut from
    <tt>fcm log</tt>.</li>

    <li>Take care to avoid making mistakes in your log messages since
    correcting them involves additional work. However, if you realise that that
    you've made a mistake don't leave it - get it corrected.

      <ul>
        <li>A log message can be corrected using the <em>propedit</em>
        command,<br>
        e.g. <tt>fcm propedit svn:log --revprop -r REV</tt><br>
        Take care since this is an <em>unversioned</em> property so you run the
        risk of losing information if you aren't careful with your edits.</li>

        <li>By default, FCM repositories are configured such that all users can
        update log messages. If you are not the original author of the changeset
        then the original author will be sent an e-mail informing them of the
        change. Other users can also be informed of log message changes if they
        wish (see the section <a href="system_admin.html#svn_watch">Watching
        changes in log messages</a> for details).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are two possible approaches to recording the changes to individual
  files:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Maintain history entries in file headers.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Pros:</em>

          <ul>
            <li>You don't need access to the Subversion repository in order to
            be able to view a files change history (e.g. external
            collaborators).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <em>Cons:</em>

          <ul>
            <li>History entries will produce clashes whenever files are changed
            in parallel (although these conflicts are trivial to resolve).</li>

            <li>Source files which are changed regularly can become cluttered
            with very long history entries.</li>

            <li>It is not possible to include history entries in some types of
            file.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Record which files have changed in the commit log message.

      <ul>
        <li>The log message should name every modified file and explain why it
        was changed. For example:

          <table class="pad" summary="Example log message" border="1" width=
          "100%">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <pre>
 * working_practices.html:
   Added guidelines for writing log messages.
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

	  Make sure that the log message includes some sort of description for
	  every change. The value of the log becomes much less if developers cannot
	  rely on its completeness. Even if you've only changed comments, note this
	  in the message.</li>

        <li>If you make exactly the same change in several files, list all the
        changed files in one entry. For example:

          <table class="pad" summary="Example log message" border="1" width=
          "100%">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <pre>
 * code_management.html, system_admin.html, index.html:
   Ran pages through tidy to fix HTML errors.
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </li>

        <li>It shouldn't normally be necessary to include the full path in the
	    file name - just make sure it is clear which of the changed files
	    you are referring to. You can get a full list of the files changed using
	    <tt>fcm&nbsp;log&nbsp;-v</tt>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you're committing to your own branch then you can be much more
  relaxed about log messages. Use whatever level of detail you find helpful.
  However, if you follow similar guidelines then this will help when it comes
  to preparing the log message when your change is merged back to the
  trunk.</p>

  <h2><a name="tickets">Trac Tickets</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="tickets_create">Creating Tickets</a></h3>

  <p>There are two different approaches to using the issue tracker within
  Trac:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>All problems should be reported using Trac tickets.

      <ul>
        <li><em>Pros:</em> The issue tracker contains a full record of all the
        problems reported and enhancements requested.</li>

        <li>
          <em>Cons:</em> The issue tracker gets cluttered up with lots of
          inappropriate tickets.

          <ul>
            <li>Duplicate tickets.</li>

            <li>Issues already discussed in the documentation.</li>

            <li>Problems which turn out to be unrelated to the system.</li>

            <li>Problems which are poorly described.</li>

            <li>Things which would be better solved by a quick
            conversation.</li>
          </ul>This makes it much harder to search the issues and can slow down
          the response to simple issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A Trac ticket shouldn't be created until the issue has been agreed.

      <ul>
        <li>Problems and issues should first be discussed with the project team
        / system maintainers. Depending on the project, this could be via
        email, on the newsgroups or through a quick chat over coffee.</li>

        <li>Nothing is lost this way. Issues which are appropriate for the
        issue tracker still get filed. It just happens slightly later, after
        initial discussion has helped to clarify the best description for the
        issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="tickets_use">Using Tickets</a></h3>

  <p>This sub-section provides advice on the best way of using tickets:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In general, mature systems will require that there is a Trac ticket related
	to every changeset made to the trunk. However this doesn't mean that there
	should be a separate ticket for each change.
	<ul>
	  <li>If a change is made to the trunk and then a bug is subsequently found then,
	      if this happens before the next release of the system, the subsequent
	      change can be recorded on the same ticket.
	  <li>There can often be changes which don't really affect the system itself since
	      they are just system administration details. One way of dealing with this
	      is to open a ticket for each release in which to record all such miscellaneous
	      changes. It will probably be acceptable to review these changes after they have
	      been committed, prior to the system release.
	</ul>
    <li>Whenever you refer to source files/directories in tickets, make sure that you refer
	to particular versions of the files. This ensures that the links will work
	in the future, even if those files are no longer in the latest version.
	For example:<br>
	<tt>Changes now ready for review:  source:/OPS/branches/dev/frdm/r123_MyBranch@234</tt>
    <li>For some types of information, simply appending to the ticket may not be the
	best way of working. For example, design notes or test results may be best recorded
	elsewhere, preferably in a wiki page. If using wiki pages we recommend using a naming
	convention to identify the wiki page with the associated ticket, for example:<br>
	<tt>Please refer to [wiki:ticket/123/Design design notes]</tt><br>
	<tt>See separate [wiki:ticket/123/TestResults test results]</tt><br>
	Note that the square brackets have to be used since a page name containing numbers is
	not recognised automatically.
  </ol>

  
  <h2><a name="packages">Creating Packages</a></h2>

  <p>Sometimes you may need to combine the changes from several different branches.
  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>Your branch is just part of a larger change which needs to be tested in its
	entirety before committing to the trunk.</li>
    <li>You have some diagnostic code stored on a branch which you want to combine
	with another branch for testing purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  We refer to this as creating a <em>package</em>.</p>

  <p>To create a package you simply create a new branch as normal. The <em>type</em> should
  be a <em>package</em> or possibly a <em>configuration</em> branch to help you distinguish
  it from your other branches. You then simply merge in all of the branches that you want to
  combine using <tt>fcm merge</tt>.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The chance of conflicts will be reduced if the branches you are combining have been
	created from the same point on the trunk. Your package branch should also be created
	from the same point on the trunk.
	<ul>
	  <li><em>Currently, <tt>fcm merge</tt> will not work unless this is true.</em></li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>If further changes are made on a branch you are using in a package then you can
	incorporate these changes into your package using <tt>fcm merge</tt>. Note, however,
	that if you have a branch which is being used in a package then you should avoid merging
	changes from the trunk into your branch. If you do then it will be very difficult to
	get updates to your branch merged into the package.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <tt>fcm branch --info</tt> command is very useful for maintaining packages. It tells
  you all of the branches which have been merged into your package and whether there are any
  more recent changes on those branches.</p>

  <h2><a name="releases">Preparing System Releases</a></h2>

  There are two ways of preparing system releases:
  <ol>
    <li>A system release is simply a particular version of the trunk. In order to do this it
	will be necessary to restrict changes on the trunk whilst the release is being prepared.
	<ul>
	  <li>Users can continue to develop changes not intended for inclusion
	      in this release on branches.
	  <li>This may be a problem if preparing the release takes too long.
	</ul>
    <li>Create a release branch where the release is finalised.
	<ul>
	  <li>You then lose the ability to be able to branch from the release.
	  <li>It may be harder to identify what changes have been made between releases
	      (since you can't simply look at all the changesets made between two versions
	      of the trunk).
	</ul>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="rapid">Rapid vs Staged Development Practises</a></h2>

  <p>Most of this section on working practises has focussed on projects/systems
  which are quite mature. Such systems are likely to have regular releases and
  will, for example, insist that all changes to the trunk are reviewed and
  tested.</p>

  <p>If your system is still undergoing rapid development and has not yet
  reached any sort of formal release then you will probably want to adopt a
  much more relaxed set of working practises. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changes don't need to be reviewed.</li>

    <li>More changes will be committed to the trunk. Only very large changes
    will be prepared on branches.</li>

    <li>No requirement to have a Trac ticket associated with each change.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have tried to avoid building too many assumptions about working
  practises into the FCM system. This gives projects the flexibility to decide
  which working practises are appropriate for their system. Hopefully this
  means that FCM can be used for large or small systems and for rapidly
  evolving or very stable systems.</p>
