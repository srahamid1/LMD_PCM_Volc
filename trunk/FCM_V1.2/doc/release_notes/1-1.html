  <h2><a name="new" id="new">What's New?</a></h2>

  <p>Build system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Support building of Fortran <span class="mono">BLOCKDATA</span> program
    units.</li>

    <li>Option to generate Fortran interface files in lower case names after
    their program units.</li>

    <li>Allow renaming of main program targets using the build configuration
    file.</li>

    <li>The <span class="mono">fcm_env.ksh</span> file now provides an
    environment variable for the <span class="mono">etc/</span> sub-directory
    of the build which can be used if you are "building" data files.</li>

    <li>The build root directory is now locked while a build is running. This
    prevents multiple instances of build running in the same directory.
    However, you can bypass the lock if you specify the new <span class=
    "mono">--ignore-lock</span> option with <span class="mono">fcm
    build</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Extract system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The destination root directory is now locked while an extract is
    running. This prevents multiple instances of extract running in the same
    directory. However, you can bypass the lock if you specify the new
    <span class="mono">--ignore-lock</span> option with <span class="mono">fcm
    extract</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Code management commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="mono">fcm merge</span> now supports custom and reverse
    modes.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm merge</span> now allows automatic merges in
    sub-trees if it is safe.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm merge</span> now handles automatic merges from
    sibling branches that are created at different revisions of the
    parent.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm branch, fcm diff --branch</span> and
    <span class="mono">fcm merge</span> can now handle creation, diff and
    automatic merge of a branch of a branch.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm switch</span> is improved to allow safer
    switches of your working copy to point to different branches in your
    project.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm commit</span> now displays your location in the
    branch, and extra warning when you are committing to the trunk of a
    project.</li>

    <li>New <span class="mono">fcm mkpatch</span> command.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>General:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Error handling is improved.</li>

    <li>The User Guide is now complete, with a much improved tutorial.</li>

    <li>New document: Fortran coding standard for FCM.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="fix" id="fix">Minor Enhancements &amp; Bug Fixes</a></h2>

  <p>Build system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ignore empty Fortran source files, so that alternate sections can be
    handled correctly.</li>

    <li>Handle recursive header file dependency correctly in pre-processing
    stage.</li>

    <li>Identify changes in pre-processed source file, the pre-processor
    options and "keys" correctly in incremental builds.</li>

    <li>Improve speed of pre-processing in incremental builds by not performing
    any unnecessary null-action pre-processing.</li>

    <li>Load archiver no longer includes main program objects.</li>

    <li>It is now possible for a sub-package to exclude particular types of
    dependencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Extract system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sub-directories are now extracted with the non-recursive mode of
    <span class="mono">svn export</span>.</li>

    <li>Peg revisions should now be handled correctly in <span class=
    "mono">INC</span> extract declarations.</li>

    <li>The command should now fail if a declared source directory does not
    exist or if the update of an extract destination fails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Code management commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="mono">fcm branch --info</span> and <span class="mono">fcm
    diff</span> can now take a <span class="mono">PATH</span> as an
    argument.</li>

    <li>The <span class="mono">--ticket</span> option of <span class="mono">fcm
    branch --create</span> can now accept multiple tickets.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm branch --info</span> and <span class="mono">fcm
    diff --branch</span> should now work correctly in a sub-tree of a
    branch.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm branch --create</span> no longer offers to
    checkout the branch.</li>

    <li><span class="mono">fcm commit</span> no longer fails when adding a new
    symbolic link.</li>

    <li>The <span class="mono">--password</span> option is now supported by the
    <span class="mono">fcm branch --create, fcm branch --delete, fcm
    commit</span> and <span class="mono">fcm delete</span> commands.</li>

    <li>Empty arguments to code management commands are now parsed
    correctly.</li>

    <li>The <span class="mono">fcm diff --graphical</span> option no longer
    fails with binary files.</li>

    <li>FCM will always set the environment variable <span class=
    "mono">LANG=en_GB</span> before running Subversion commands. This prevents
    failure of FCM when it attempts to parse output from Subversion commands
    when a different <span class="mono">LANG</span> setting is used.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>General:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Various other very minor enhancements and bug fixes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="req" id="req">System Requirements</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="req_perl" id="req_perl">Perl</a></h3>

  <p>The core part of FCM is a set of Perl scripts and modules. For the build
  system to work, you need the following modules installed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">Carp</li>

    <li class="mono">Cwd</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Basename</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Compare</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Find</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Path</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Spec::Functions</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Spec</li>

    <li class="mono">FindBin</li>

    <li class="mono">Getopt::Long</li>

    <li class="mono">POSIX</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The code management commands and extract system need the following
  additional modules installed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">File::Temp</li>

    <li class="mono">Getopt::Long</li>

    <li class="mono">HTTP::Date</li>

    <li class="mono">XML::DOM</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To use the simple GUI for some of the code management commands, you also
  need the following modules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">Tk::ROText</li>

    <li class="mono">Tk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the Met Office we are currently using the complete FCM system with Perl
  5.8.x. In addition the build system is being used with Perl 5.6.x.</p>

  <h3><a name="req_svn" id="req_svn">Subversion</a></h3>

  <p>To use the code management commands (and relevant parts of the extract
  system) you need to have <a href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>FCM makes extensive use of peg revisions in both the code management
    and extract systems. This requires Subversion 1.2.0.</li>

    <li>At the Met Office we are currently using Subversion 1.3.2 (although
    1.2.3 was used until very recently).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the extract system can mirror extracted code to a remote
  platform for building. Therefore it is only necessary to have Subversion
  installed on the platform where you do your code development. If you use
  other platforms purely for building and running then you do not need to have
  Subversion installed on these platforms.</p>

  <h3><a name="req_trac" id="req_trac">Trac</a></h3>

  <p>The use of <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> is
  entirely optional (although highly recommended if you are using Subversion).
  At the Met Office we are currently using version 0.9.6.</p>

  <h3><a name="req_other" id="req_other">Other Requirements</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>fcm diff --graphical</tt> and <tt>fcm conflicts</tt> commands
  require <a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a>. At the Met Office we
  are currently using version 3.1.</p>

  <p>The build system requires <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>. At the Met Office
  we are currently using version 3.79.x and 3.80.</p>

  <p>Optionally, the build system can use <a href=
  "http://www.ifremer.fr/ditigo/molagnon/fortran90">f90aib</a> to generate
  interface files. However, there is also a built in Perl based interface file
  generator which is quicker and better in most cases so you are unlikely to
  need f90aib unless you hit a problem with some particular code.</p>

  <p>FCM is intended to run on a Unix/Linux system. It is currently used at the
  Met Office on Linux (Red Hat 9 and Red Hat Enterprise 2.1 and 4.4) and HP-UX
  11.00.</p>

  <h2><a name="ins" id="ins">Installation</a></h2>

  <p>FCM is distributed in the form of a compressed tar file. Un-pack the tar
  file into an appropriate location on your system. Then add the <tt>bin</tt>
  directory into your PATH. Once you have done this you should now have full
  access to the FCM system, assuming that you have met the requirements
  described in the previous section.</p>

  <p>If you wish to define keywords for your systems you will need to create a
  file <tt>etc/fcm.cfg</tt>. An example file, <tt>fcm.cfg.eg</tt>, is provided
  which is a copy of the file currently used at the Met Office. For further
  details please refer to the section <a href=
  "../user_guide/system_admin.html#fcm-keywords">FCM keywords</a> in the System
  Admin chapter of the User Guide.</p>

  <p>The <tt>doc</tt> directory contains all the system documentation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>doc/release_notes</tt> contains these release notes. It also
    contains the release notes for all previous versions which may be useful if
    you have skipped any versions.</li>

    <li><tt>doc/user_guide</tt> contains the FCM User Guide in both <a href=
    "../user_guide/index.html">HTML</a> and <a href=
    "../user_guide/fcm-user-guide.pdf">PDF</a> form.</li>

    <li><tt>doc/design</tt> contains the <a href="../design/index.html">FCM
    Detailed Design</a> document (currently in draft form).</li>

    <li><tt>doc/standards</tt> contains the FCM <a href=
    "../standards/perl_standard.html">Perl</a> and <a href=
    "../standards/fortran_standard.html">Fortran</a> coding standards. The Perl
    standard describes the standards followed by the FCM code. The Fortran
    standard contains some <a href=
    "../standards/fortran_standard.html#fcm">specific advice</a> on the best
    way of writing Fortran code for use with FCM as well as more general advice
    on good practise.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <tt>tutorial</tt> directory contains the files necessary to set up a
  tutorial repository. This will allow you to follow the <a href=
  "../user_guide/getting_started.html#tutorial">tutorial section</a> in the
  User Guide.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The file <tt>tutorial/repos/tutorial.dump</tt> should be loaded into an
    empty repository using the <tt>svnadmin load</tt> command.</li>

    <li>The hook scripts in <tt>tutorial/hook</tt> should then be installed in
    this repository in order to prevent any commits to the trunk. Note that the
    configuration file <tt>svnperms.conf</tt> assumes that the tutorial
    repository is called <tt>tutorial_svn</tt>. Please edit this file if you
    use a different name.</li>

    <li>The repository should be configured to allow users write access. You
    may find it easiest to simply allow anonymous access.</li>

    <li>A Trac system should be configured associated with the Tutorial
    repository. You then need to allow users write access. You may find it
    easiest to set up a number of guest accounts for this purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <tt>templates</tt> directory contains various example scripts which
  you may find useful. Note that these scripts are all specific to the Met
  Office and may contain hard coded paths and email addresses. They are
  provided in the hope that you may find them useful as templates for setting
  up similar scripts of your own. However, they should only be used after
  careful review to adapt them to your environment. The contents are as
  follows:</p>

  <table summary="list of template scripts" border="1" width="100%">

      <td>
        This script restricts write-access to the repository by checking the
        following:

        <ul>
          <li>It executes the Subversion utility <tt>svnperms.py</tt> if it
          exists. This utility checks whether the author of the current
          transaction has enough permission to write to particular paths in the
          repository.</li>

          <li>It checks the disk space required by the current transaction. It
          fails the commit if it requires more than 5Mb of disk space.</li>
