  <h2><a name="new" id="new">What's New?</a></h2>

  <p>Code management commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New options <tt>--trac</tt> and <tt>--wiki</tt> for <tt>fcm diff
    --branch</tt>.</li>

    <li>Allow other graphical diff tools to be used in place of <em>xxdiff</em>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>General:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New document <em>External Distribution &amp; Collaboration for FCM
    Projects</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="fix" id="fix">Minor enhancements &amp; Bug Fixes</a></h2>

  <p>Build system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Extra warnings when multiple targets are detected in the source
    tree.</li>

    <li>Improved the patterns for detecting <em>recursive</em>, <em>pure</em>
    and <em>elemental</em> Fortran subroutines and functions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Code management commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>fcm branch --list</tt> now prints the branches using FCM URL
    keywords by default. Use the <tt>--verbose</tt> option to print branches
    in full Subversion URLs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>General:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Enhanced <tt>fcm cmp-ext-cfg</tt> to link to tickets.</li>

    <li>Improved handling of FCM URL keywords. The <tt>SET::REPOS</tt>
    declaration in the central/user configuration file is deprecated in favour
    of <tt>SET::URL</tt>. The keyword of the project with the standard suffices
    (<tt>_tr</tt> or <tt>-tr</tt> for "trunk", <tt>_br</tt> or <tt>-br</tt> for
    "branches", and <tt>_tg</tt> or <tt>-tg</tt> for "tags") are recognised
    automatically.</li>

    <li>Fix: full extract/build should no longer delete one another's cache if
    they are run in the same directory.</li>

    <li>Various other very minor enhancements and bug fixes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="req" id="req">System Requirements</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="req_perl" id="req_perl">Perl</a></h3>

  <p>The core part of FCM is a set of Perl scripts and modules. For the build
  system to work, you need the following modules installed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">Carp</li>

    <li class="mono">Cwd</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Basename</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Compare</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Find</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Path</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Spec::Functions</li>

    <li class="mono">File::Spec</li>

    <li class="mono">FindBin</li>

    <li class="mono">Getopt::Long</li>

    <li class="mono">POSIX</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The code management commands and extract system need the following
  additional modules installed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">File::Temp</li>

    <li class="mono">Getopt::Long</li>

    <li class="mono">HTTP::Date</li>

    <li class="mono">XML::DOM</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To use the simple GUI for some of the code management commands, you also
  need the following modules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="mono">Tk::ROText</li>

    <li class="mono">Tk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the Met Office we are currently using the complete FCM system with Perl
  5.8.x. In addition the build system is being used with Perl 5.6.x.</p>

  <h3><a name="req_svn" id="req_svn">Subversion</a></h3>

  <p>To use the code management commands (and relevant parts of the extract
  system) you need to have <a href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>FCM makes extensive use of peg revisions in both the code management
    and extract systems. This requires Subversion 1.2.0.</li>

    <li>At the Met Office we are currently using Subversion 1.3.2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the extract system can mirror extracted code to a remote
  platform for building. Therefore it is only necessary to have Subversion
  installed on the platform where you do your code development. If you use
  other platforms purely for building and running then you do not need to have
  Subversion installed on these platforms.</p>

  <h3><a name="req_trac" id="req_trac">Trac</a></h3>

  <p>The use of <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> is
  entirely optional (although highly recommended if you are using Subversion).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <tt>--trac</tt> and <tt>--wiki</tt> options to the <tt>fcm diff
    --branch</tt> command allow you to view branch differences using Trac. This
    requires Trac 0.10.</li>

    <li>At the Met Office we are currently using Trac 0.10.3.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="req_other" id="req_other">Other Requirements</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>fcm conflicts</tt> command requires <a href=
  "http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a>. At the Met Office we are currently
  using version 3.1. The <tt>fcm diff --graphical</tt> command also uses xxdiff
  by default although other graphical diff tools can also be used.</p>

  <p>The build system requires <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>. At the Met Office
  we are currently using version 3.79.x and 3.80.</p>

  <p>Optionally, the build system can use <a href=
  "http://www.ifremer.fr/ditigo/molagnon/fortran90">f90aib</a> to generate
  interface files. However, there is also a built in Perl based interface file
  generator which is quicker and better in most cases so you are unlikely to
  need f90aib unless you hit a problem with some particular code.</p>

  <p>FCM is intended to run on a Unix/Linux system. It is currently used at the
  Met Office on Linux (Red Hat Enterprise 2.1 and 4.4) and HP-UX 11.00.</p>

  <h2><a name="ins" id="ins">Installation</a></h2>

  <p>FCM is distributed in the form of a compressed tar file. Un-pack the tar
  file into an appropriate location on your system. Then add the <tt>bin</tt>
  directory into your PATH. Once you have done this you should now have full
  access to the FCM system, assuming that you have met the requirements
  described in the previous section.</p>

  <p>If you wish to define keywords for your systems you will need to create a
  file <tt>etc/fcm.cfg</tt>. An example file, <tt>fcm.cfg.eg</tt>, is provided
  which is a copy of the file currently used at the Met Office. For further
  details please refer to the section <a href=
  "../user_guide/system_admin.html#fcm-keywords">FCM keywords</a> in the System
  Admin chapter of the User Guide.</p>

  <p>The <tt>doc</tt> directory contains all the system documentation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>doc/release_notes</tt> contains these release notes. It also
    contains the release notes for all previous versions which may be useful if
    you have skipped any versions.</li>

    <li><tt>doc/user_guide</tt> contains the <a href="../user_guide/index.html">
    FCM User Guide</a>.</li>

    <li><tt>doc/design</tt> contains the <a href="../design/index.html">FCM
    Detailed Design</a> document (currently in draft form).</li>

    <li><tt>doc/standards</tt> contains the FCM <a href=
    "../standards/perl_standard.html">Perl</a> and <a href=
    "../standards/fortran_standard.html">Fortran</a> coding standards. The Perl
    standard describes the standards followed by the FCM code. The Fortran
    standard contains some <a href=
    "../standards/fortran_standard.html#fcm">specific advice</a> on the best
    way of writing Fortran code for use with FCM as well as more general advice
    on good practise.</li>

    <li><tt>doc/collaboration</tt> contains the <a href=
    "../collaboration/index.html">External Distribution &amp; Collaboration for
    FCM Projects</a> document which discusses how projects configured under FCM
    can be distributed externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <tt>tutorial</tt> directory contains the files necessary to set up a
  tutorial repository. This will allow you to follow the <a href=
  "../user_guide/getting_started.html#tutorial">tutorial section</a> in the
  User Guide.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The file <tt>tutorial/repos/tutorial.dump</tt> should be loaded into an
    empty repository using the <tt>svnadmin load</tt> command.</li>

    <li>The hook scripts in <tt>tutorial/hook</tt> should then be installed in
    this repository in order to prevent any commits to the trunk. Note that the
    configuration file <tt>svnperms.conf</tt> assumes that the tutorial
    repository is called <tt>tutorial_svn</tt>. Please edit this file if you
    use a different name.</li>

    <li>The repository should be configured to allow users write access. You
    may find it easiest to simply allow anonymous access.</li>

    <li>A Trac system should be configured associated with the Tutorial
    repository. You then need to allow users write access. You may find it
    easiest to set up a number of guest accounts for this purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <tt>templates</tt> directory contains various example scripts which
  you may find useful. Note that these scripts are all specific to the Met
  Office and may contain hard coded paths and email addresses. They are
  provided in the hope that you may find them useful as templates for setting
  up similar scripts of your own. However, they should only be used after
  careful review to adapt them to your environment. The contents are as
  follows:</p>

  <table summary="list of template scripts" border="1" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Script</th>

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>templates/hook/pre-commit</th>

      <td>
        This script restricts write-access to the repository by checking the
        following:

        <ul>
          <li>It executes the Subversion utility <tt>svnperms.py</tt> if it
          exists. This utility checks whether the author of the current
          transaction has enough permission to write to particular paths in the
          repository.</li>

          <li>It checks the disk space required by the current transaction. It
          fails the commit if it requires more than 5Mb of disk space.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>templates/hook/post-commit</th>

      <td>
        This script runs in the background after each commit

        <ul>
          <li>It updates a <tt>&lt;repos&gt;.latest</tt> file with the latest
          revision number.</li>

          <li>It creates a dump of the new revision.</li>

          <li>It calls the script <tt>background_updates.pl</tt> if it
          exists.</li>
        </ul>This script is installed as standard in all our repositories.

      <td>An example of how you may want to set up a
      <tt>background_updates.pl</tt> script to perform post-commit tasks for a
      specific repository. This script uses a lock file to prevent multiple
      commits in quick succession from causing problems.</td>
