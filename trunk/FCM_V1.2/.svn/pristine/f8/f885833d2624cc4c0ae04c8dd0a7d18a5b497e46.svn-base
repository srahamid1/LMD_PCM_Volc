  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This document contains the Detailed Design for the <em>Flexible
  Configuration Management</em> system which is known as <em>FCM</em>.</p>

  <p>A lot of information about the design of FCM can be found within:</p>

  <ul class="pad">
    <li>The <a href="../user_guide">FCM User Guide</a>. This contains all the
    information which a user needs to know about FCM, including relevant
    aspects of the design.</li>

    <li>The FCM source code which is, we hope, well commented.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Everything else which you might need to know about the design should be
  described in the following sections. It includes higher level design
  information not suited for inclusion in the source code but too detailed to
  be included in the User Guide. It is intended for those who need to maintain
  or develop the FCM system or simply for those who wish to obtain a deeper
  understanding of how the system works. This document consists of the following
  sections:</p>

  <ul class="pad">
    <li><a href="code_management.html">Code Management System</a></li>

    <li><a href="extract.html">Extract System</a></li>

    <li><a href="build.html">Build System</a></li>
  </ul>
